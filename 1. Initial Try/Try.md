# Initial Try

Using the starting sample code in the `Try.java` file, try to create the output below. That is, when you run `Try.java`, try to make it match the following:

```
Hello, World
Hello, World
Hello, World
```

The code in the file is close to complete on each line, just fill in the missing piece!

Once you have achieved the output shown above, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
