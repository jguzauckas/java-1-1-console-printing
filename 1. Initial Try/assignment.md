# Assignment

Using the starting sample code in the `Assignment.java` file, try to create the output below. That is, when you run `Assignment.java`, try to make it match the following:

```
This is
sample code
I like      having large spaces in my "code"
I can write \ and /
```

Can you make this happen with a combination of `print` and `println` statements? Can you use escape character sequences to make this easier?

Once you have achieved the output shown above, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
