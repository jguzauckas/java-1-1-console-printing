# You Do

Can you make the program draw a face on it's output?

```
 +"""""+
[| o o |]
 |  ^  |
 | '-' |
 +-----+
```

Make your face different from the example here, but be creative with your characters!

Try and make the program draw two faces side-by-side!

Once you have achieved the output shown above, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
