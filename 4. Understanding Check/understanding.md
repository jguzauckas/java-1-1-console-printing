# Understanding Check

ASCII Art is a fun way to draw with characters in a command line. We can use our new print commands to draw like with ASCII Art!

Here is an example of `Type-writer-style` lettering, where we make larger letters out of themselves:

```
H   H EEEEE L     L      OOO       W   W  OOO  RRRR  L     DDDD  !!
H   H E     L     L     O   O      W W W O   O R   R L     D   D !!
HHHHH EEEEE L     L     O   O      W W W O   O RRRR  L     D   D !!
H   H E     L     L     O   O  ,,   W W  O   O R   R L     D   D
H   H EEEEE LLLLL LLLLL  OOO  ,,    W W   OOO  R   R LLLLL DDDD  !!
```

Make your own name with this style?

We can use diagonal lines like slashes to create basic "trees":

```
   /\
  /  \
   ||
```

Draw a tree that is at least 7 lines tall (this sample tree was 3 lines tall). Can you add ornaments to it like a holiday tree would have?

Once you have achieved the output shown above, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
